# NVGT Includes Contribution

## Guidelines

Before discussing about how you could contribute, please the following guidelines to insure a safe environment, stability, and readability.

### Code Indentation
If possible, please do not use indentation, since this language is not required to use it.

#### Good
```
void test()
{
alert("hello","testing");
}
```

#### Bad
```
void test()
{
	alert("hello","testing");
}
```

### Code blocks
If possible, please use new line for each code block.

#### Good
```
void test()
{
int x=random(1,3);
if(x==2)
{
alert("Yep","the x is 2, lucky!");
}
else if(x==1)
{
alert("Yep","the most luckyest number!");
}
}
```

#### Bad
```
void test() {
int x=random(1,3);
if(x==2) {
alert("Yep","the x is 2, lucky!");
}
else if(x==1) {
alert("Yep","the most luckyest number!");
}
}
```

### Final

Go back to your forked repository on your browser. Then, click on contribute submenu.

Then, click on `create new pull request`. Next, write helpful description of what you've just made changes and click on `create pull request` button or something similar.

### Updates

To do that, go back to your forked repository in your browser.

Next, click on `synk fork` submenu. at the bottom, click on `update branch` button. If you can't see the button, meaning you're up to date. It will also indicate with the message that is up to date or not.
